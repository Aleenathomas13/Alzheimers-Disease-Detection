# About the project
The main objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting and classifying Alzheimer’s disease using brain MRI scans. By using the DenseNet-121 architecture, the model aims to distinguish between three stages of cognitive health—Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN). The goal is to provide an efficient, accurate, and non-invasive tool to assist in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer’s progression.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project was collected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a publicly available repository of neuroimaging data. The MRI scans were preprocessed and divided into three categories:
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD): Patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI): Patients with early signs of memory decline but not full Alzheimer’s.
Cognitively Normal (CN): Healthy control subjects with no cognitive impairment.
